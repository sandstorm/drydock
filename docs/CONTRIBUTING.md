# Contributing

We'd love to have pull requests or bug reports :-) In case we do not react timely,
do not hesitate to get in touch with us e.g. via [kontakt@sandstorm.de](mailto:kontakt@sandstorm.de),
as it might happen that a pull request slips through.

## Developing

Simply have a modern Go version installed; check out the project somewhere (NOT in $GOPATH, as we use Go Modules),
and then run `./dev.sh build`.
